#Branching Strategy
The branching strategy that i will use is GitFlow whereby   i will interact with a version control system for writing and managing code.

#Use of .Giltmore
When making commits to each repository, i will choose the files i  want to stage and then i will commit them.
But i might not want to commit every single one of my filesâ€”there are files that never need to get committed. This is where the .gitignore file is useful: it tells Git exactly which files to ignore and never track.
